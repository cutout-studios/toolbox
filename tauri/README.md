# `@cutout/tauri`

**The Idea**: Embed `Deno` in a
[cross-platform Tauri application](https://v2.tauri.app/distribute/). Have
`Deno` run a `@cutout/web` server that the Tauri webview loads.

> [!CAUTION]
> We're currently researching the viability of this approach. It seems promising

## De-risking iOS cross-compilation

While all other major platforms seem to be accounted for, iOS forbids JIT-ful
processes like V8, making it the biggest hurdle for this approach.

So far we've been able to create
[a repeatable iOS simulator build](./scripts/buildApple/main.sh) for
`deno_core`. The next steps are to:

- [ ] Link this `rlib` into a Tauri app and exercise it in the iOS Simulator.
- [ ] Review the available extensions via
      [`deno/ext`](https://github.com/denoland/deno/tree/main/ext) and
      prioritize their support. We believe if `deno_core` can be successfully
      exercised in a Tauri app, a majority of these extensions can eventually
      have iOS support with Tauri's help (with some key execptions).

## Security Considerations

- The local server is a blatent attack surface: bind to `127.0.0.1` with an
  ephemeral port.
- Lock down the host and origin on every request. Use a per-session header-based
  token.
- Strictly configure CORS and CSP.
