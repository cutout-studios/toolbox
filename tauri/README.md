# `@cutout/tauri`

## The Idea

- Embed `Deno` in a Tauri application. Have `Deno` run a `@cutout/web` server
  that the Tauri webview loads.
  - Also, expose a "Capabilties" HTTP API/channel that the `@cutout/web` server
    can use to make native calls.

## iOS de-risking TODOs

iOS forbids JIT-ful processes. All other platforms are in some state accounted
for. De-risking the iOS path blocks this module's development.

> State of community efforts: https://github.com/denoland/rusty_v8/issues/1640.

- [ ] Compile and exercise the Deno stack for iOS:
  - [x] Successfully compile jitless `rusty_v8` for iOS Simulator.
  - [x] Successfully compile `deno_core` with the already compiled `rusty_v8` as
        dependency. (This is now captured with the `buildApple` deno task.)
  - [ ] Link `deno_core` into a Tauri app and exercise it on the iOS Simulator.
  - [ ] Determine which extensions (`deno/lib/ext`) will be easy to add.

- [ ] **Ensure `@cutout/jsx` is jitless-friendly.** Jitless V8
      [runs everything through the interpreter](https://v8.dev/blog/jitless#:~:text=Essentially%2C%20V8%20switches%20into%20an,pattern%20matching%20is%20likewise%20interpreted.),
      and some patterns — generators in particular — have poor interpreter-mode
      performance. The `@cutout/jsx` renderer
      [leans on generator-based traversal in places](../web/BENCHMARKS.md); we
      need a **flattened-generator mode** that emits non-generator equivalents
      for the jitless target.
